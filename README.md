# TITLE:  Balena Database: My adventures in adding a Distributed Database for collecting sensor data 
# TL;DR
TODO
### 
# Background:
I've been following the developments of IPFS for the past 2-3ish years. and wanted to add it to one my future projects. Collecting sensor data from a bunch of raspberry pi's, in a offline way. seemed like a good fit.



Why this project would be helpful?
Imaging your setting up a new fleet of 10x RPI4's with temperature sensors, and you need a quick way to collect all the data from all the sensors streaming data in from the sensors. And you don't feel like setting up a full scale database, or the complexities of a cloud database.
Ideally this would be as easy as adding something that looks like this to your docker file
```
  dashboard:
    image: balenablocks/database:raspberrypi4
    restart: always
    volumes:
        - 'database-data:/data'
```
##### Note this is an idea of what it would look like

# The Problem:
Grab sensor data from 2-to- thousands of devices, in a offline first way, with minimal to no setup.

## What is IPFS?
TODO
## What are distributed databases?
`a database in which data is stored across different physical locations.[1] It may be stored in multiple computers located in the same physical location (e.g. a data centre); or maybe dispersed over a network of interconnected computers.`  - [Distributed Database: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database)

## Why are they important for this problem:

# Solution:

# Trail #1 Defining the problem
Which database software should I use? Orbit db or Gun.js db?

- get a balena blocks sample project that uses the connector block
- Run through a getting started with IPFS tutorial
- send link of this post to the IPFS and Orbis DB community for addtional throughs and help
